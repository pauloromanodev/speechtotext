The joe rogan experience. When we talk about what are the ideologies that drive us the ideology of progress this is why i have sometimes i'm skeptical not about technology the mastery and the geniuses that work in that field but how technology and science as a subset of our economic ideology can create exactly the conditions that you are describing that journalist has exposed that if your ideology permits that then what kind of ideology is that what kind of unconsciousness are we living in it's not an awakened culture and all of the discourse around like you know how we treat one another is individuals and progressivism culturally and domestic territories hey people should be allowed to do this and that is all nonsense required it's a requirement you cannot have that economic model without that price being paid and as a culture whether it's me is an individual or our entire culture we've accepted that contract with accepted those term. Well we we have in some areas of our life for sure. You know hopefully people haven't done that in their interpersonal intimate relationships but. We certainly have and the way we communicate with others. We we've certainly accepted like very bizarre ways of communicating online. And sometimes that bleeds out into real life like where someone talks to people in the real world as if they're on twitter and they get bashed. Like you see that sometimes. I think it's a it's a very strange time where we i don't think people have. A lot of faith right now. In institutions. And i don't think they have a lot of faith in authority i don't think they really believe that there is someone who is a wiser than them that has a grand plan that's logical. Workable where they're looking out for all of us. So i think there's like a feeling of chaos that exist today that i don't think is ever existed in my life like this before. Even back during like the bush administration when they you know everybody thought bush was a moron. They they still. There's a good cabinet and they they're following all the checks and balances even though they're probably extracting too much money and they probably it's probably a lot of cronyism and a lot of undercover deals and a lot of like no big contracts with halliburton and that kind of nonsense he still thought they they have things pretty under control it's a very solid institution nobody believes that now you see people harris and and biden can't get a sentence out like this is madness these people are utter fools and these are the people that are running everything and these are the people that are getting us on the brink of war with russia and i don't have any faith in them and i think most people don't i think you're right and with the that era of the chinese yes the middle east it's part of a new american project we can sort of understood it but you know where i'm coming from it was somehow recognizable and a million people went on a march to prevent that war taking place because they know they were no weapons of mass destruction which we now know to be the truth and as you say now the figures that are in that place are. Posing as the good guys like affable and avuncular presidents and. Friendly people have learned that across the identitarian spectrum that's meant to feel inclusive until the wrapping themselves up with progressive identity politics and then promoting a war yes at the same time it's very wild yeah it feels like a a mask and a veil like this is what's interesting for me is that as we navigate this new and emergent space of being able to prevent counter narratives. I'm continually like all of us now of like experience oh you're right wing conspiracy theorist you've joined it all right you're a gateway to this the dog with all of that language that goes up around it like this and i've heard you speak about this obviously a lot but the truth is that who isn't sympathetic who is anyone that's got family or love someone is simple affected the idea that people are going to have various types of identity around culture and religious expression and racial expression and this is a conversation that the whole culture has to be involved in together what my issue is i don't think they believe in that stuff i don't think they care i don't think that they are creating an agenda to advance the interest of vulnerable people and they are using it as a distraction and a veil in order to carry on with the same kind of corporate and financial interests that have always determine what the establishment is and if there's one thing we can point to in our lifetime is that the liberal establishment has become co-opted by the same forces that traditionally we regarded the right to have been collected by military evidence for that and in order to not acknowledge that that transition's taken place they're able to keep the cultural conversation going we care about your right to express yourself and your identity that's a way of not acknowledging we're just the same we're pro war and now in this at war you know like jimmy door and all those guys did that anti-war marching washington or whatever it's like 5,000 people go now i don't know if that's because of the last few years and what the pandemics done to people accumulate and gathering crowds or whether people have lost their the belief and faith. People have any can i have any impact on politics anymore there's just now this immersive sense of apathy this as you say loss of trust in in institutions and authority but something extraordinary has happened when people that say that they're you know we're the peace and love party are the party that are advocating for war won't include some of the complex conditions that have led to this current crisis which. This clearly a case for like you know neighbors infringement on russian territory the 2014 coup and i'm not telling you anything you don't know but like it's extraordinary that those conversations don't happen it's like actually like the post trump and post pandemic everything sort of end is into that template there are certain things you're not allowed to say now if you still say did were russia in any way provoked is there any legitimacy to this to their military to their military actions from their perspective that's the same as saying i don't think you should take certain medications in case the conversation went in this direction show in my new positions literacy to fact.
