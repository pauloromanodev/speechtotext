that place celebrates comedy like boston comedy is like it's very important to people that live in boston yeah and when comics succeed and they come back to boston it's a very special thing it feels amazing i did the the garden when i did the garden i was like i was gonna cry yeah like before i got on stage i was like this is nuts yeah for me that was the orpheum because that's where i used to go to see concerts yeah and when i played the orpheum last year it was the last show i did of the tour it was very emotional yeah it's it's it's a it's a special place and it's one of the most important places for the development of comedy you think of all the great comics that have come from there jay leno like people forget how good jay leno was jay leno when he was just to stand up before he hosted the tonight show was one of the best [ __ ] comics alive ever one of the best ever i love jay jay's [ __ ] i remember when i was working on conan as a writer and jay came to do uh panel you know to be interviewed on cohen it was like a favor you know because he was the bigger guy it was early in conan's tenure but he sat and did bits like he used to on letterman like he didn't talk about the tonight show he just did bits and one of them was he said i was out at the hotel today and i oh he goes i went i went to cvs to buy something and uh i paid and the woman didn't even look at me she just gave me my change and uh and i go that's it no thank you nor have a nice day she says it's on the receipt this is a [ __ ] great bit that is great he was still he's just uh i loved him so much and on the tonight show he was you know some people hated him whatever it's easy easy to make fun of him yeah um but i i don't know i he gave me the lead spot on the tonight show way before anybody else did way before any other i was doing letterman i was doing conan but i was always like two or three and leno they told i had it was booked to be the second guest but they told me jay said he wants you promoted he wants to be first and do two segments like [ __ ] reynolds that's amazing and i was like what and he like he liked our rapport i think i also brought out some funny in him yeah but that was a huge thing that he did for me and to this day like every time throughout my career once i knew jay i every time something good would happen if i won an emmy hosted snl or did something that people heard about i knew i'd get a call from jay and he just leaves a voice mailing i don't know how to reach him i don't have his number he just leaves a voicemail and says hey that's all you did this now this is just good job i'm real happy for you and he has nothing he wants from me right but he always called me and then when i had a my my bad time i thought i'm not going to hear from jay again and he called me and he left the same message just said hey man i hope you're doing okay you know everybody loves you you're okay and you know he's never not been there he's a real men she's a real really great guy i just think it's important to say because he's caught a lot of [ __ ] from the community he's caught a lot of [ __ ] for no reason i mean i get he was hosting a tonight show and it's a different sort of thing and the monologue was very homogenized but if you hang out with him and you talk like he did my podcast and he told a story about doing stand-up for a bunch of mob guys and uh that this mob guy he tells a story about this mob guy yelling at a preacher because the priest like said something and he was like [ __ ] didn't we give you enough money and he's screaming and swearing as this mob guy and i'm like this is [ __ ] incredible i remember while he was telling the story i was like this is amazing because you got to see the real jay leno that's right no he's a viciously funny guy but i understood this tonight's show strategy when i watched him in an interview once and he said my goal is to come up with jokes that have the broadest possible appeal like that's just how he thinks about that job yeah jokes that every single person can like on some level and obviously those are watered-down easy jokes you know and even he was i was on once and kathy lee was kathy gifford yeah was the lead guest and she's talking about her son cody and she says you know the the he has a stage in his bedroom and jay's like what she's he's got a stage in lights her son she's she says you know kids kids love to put on uh shows and he goes yeah the gay kids do [Laughter] [ __ ] place went crazy the tonight show audience went nuts laughing and she was dope she had tears she was laughing so hard and i saw him after this in the segment break go up to somebody and go like this they cut it out it was it didn't air and i know that was him going like don let's not use that let's not use that so that's his goal people get to have their own [ __ ] goals well to those guys that were coming up in that era that spot was the crown that was that was the that was the throne if you could host the tonight show you were the [ __ ] man and everybody wanted the tonight show gig and he protected that thing yeah like it was a sacred institution right and that's what he had always wanted and he still did stand up so he has a strange strategy though he doesn't have any material that's out there he goes hey if i put my stuff out there that [ __ ] you know much still believes that he's still believing i'll lose a half a million dollars and think he had this idea in his head that he couldn't do his act then because his act would be out there which is you know that's his take on things he's at his best doing his car show because that's when you get to see the real jay leno's because he [ __ ] loves cars yes i've had so many conversations with that guy he'll just go deep into cars and just he loves them and it's not like he loves like cars that make him look like a baller no he's he loves like old steam powered engines he loves like weird [ __ ] tires he knows everything everything at one time i did the tonight show and after my set uh he said hey stick around are you do you have to go somewhere and i was like no you know yeah hang around i didn't know what that meant so i went back to my room with my um dressing room and one of the producers said hey jay wants to talk to you you know so hang on i didn't know what it was so i so i waited for a while and he comes with he's got a motorcycle helmet and he goes hey let me show you my that's my new bike he takes me out and shows me he has a jet motorcycle it was he had created it it's a jet engine with a motorcycle frame built around it and i go wow is that a jet he goes yeah yeah it's i took it out of a helicopter and i put it on this uh and he starts it and there's this blue flame coming out of the bag he puts down the visor and he just takes off and he's not circling around he just i just hear him fading in the distance and i go to the producers so is that and she goes yeah you can go he didn't even say anything like talking yeah look at this also imagine this guy who's the host of the tonight show who just rides a motorcycle to work yep like he would ride a motorcycle to work all the time like all the [ __ ] money that's banking on him it's the biggest [ __ ] show and talk show and this guy's out there on a motorcycle experimental motorcycle he told me another time because i asked him about that bike that he got he had to pay for a guy's lamborghini because he melted the front of the lambo it was too close and he gunned it and he just melted the whole front of a car so well he probably had spare parts at his [ __ ] place sure he has 11 garages there's 11 warehouses filled with cars when i went to his place i saw one warehouse and i was like this is incredible i brought my car there and we did this little segment on my car and he goes yeah i got 11 of these i go you have 11 of these he goes yeah basically 10 was not enough he's got 11 giant warehouses filled with cars and it's [ __ ] immaculate like you could eat off the floor and there's all these really cool old automotive signs in the wall and it's like [ __ ] strange incredible now i have to piss sorry oh god perfect timing i like
