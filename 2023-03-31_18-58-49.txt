The Joe Rogan Experience the thing I'm excited has to bring it back to my stupid plug but the garden show uh I haven't been I used to do it it was normal to do the garden for me before which is not a good thing right like I remember Chris Rock saying to me once after a show at the Garden he's like you you like this is like a club for you where you try [ __ ] out now because I did it like five times in a week I just take the subway to take the C train up do the garden and leave like I don't party after I just destroy it right right but it's that went away and I hadn't been there for a while but now to me this one show there's like this very exciting thought yeah to just do one and the set of prepared for it is not a rock star set it's it's pretty gritty it's pretty I mean it all kills it's similar to what I saw at the creek yeah I've been working on it since so there's a lot of new stuff yeah but it's um the idea of being surrounded by these 18 000 people in this in this Elite Arena saying some of this stuff but but also knowing that I've crafted it so it's not just Reckless you know what I mean right right yeah I'm really I'm really excited about I don't 38 years in coming I don't get that excited but I'm really excited I'm excited for it too I I love that you've made this return and then you know you experienced a bunch of resistance but now it's kind of gone you know yeah just Mike just keep doing it just keep doing it and now you're you're doing [ __ ] that's really being recognized like you want to [ __ ] Emmy yeah I've got Grammy I got one Grammy Grammy since I came back yeah yeah that was nice it's nice and I think you won a Grammy for the special this it was very funny but I think the next one was I think sorry was even better thank you man I really do so I got nominated for a Grammy so we'll see what happens I hope it wins I'd love it if you want two years in a row I want to see people get crazy like [ __ ] you know whatever [ __ ] whatever God damn it I loved it I got so angry when people were calling out your uh that leak set yeah and people are mad because to me it was like that's what he's always done this is great stuff like not only that you hadn't didn't stand up in 10 months I'm like this is the this is the seeds of a fantastic hour well you're only seeing like literally the first couple of times he's even said these things aloud in public I literally was having a conversation with another comedian and came up with the bits and went on stage and did them so it was the first time I'd done them and I I just got so excited to be back on stage because I had taken a long time off and it was and there was is resistance coming back but I was it was I was in a club with my crowd for the first time and so I was uh it was the only thing I regret is it was Reckless because my life was very in precarious things were tough and things were tough for my kids so that created a bigger huge stink bomb than anything else that had even happened yeah the set was really really hard so I I given how uh things were I probably could have made jokes about a couple other things I don't believe I did anything wrong you did what you always I do I've always done this the way it works is I say stuff that is the wrong thing to say I hear the resistance to it and then I and then I work with it and work with it and it takes a few shows for it to be a safe bit to do but there's a few audiences that that you know and that audience actually didn't didn't mind it but it's not for regular consumption it's like watching somebody practice piano yeah and going like he sucks or or it's not it wasn't supposed to the I think it's really bad that we don't have these barriers anymore where there's speech that's for these few people there's speech we're gonna we're gonna have a fun conversation where we're gonna get a little crazy it's not for the whole world to see well what was infuriating to me was people that know that they know what you're saying yeah and they went after you I was like you [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah there's people that I won't talk to to this day because of that wow I was like I'm not talking to you like unless you want to make some like big public apology or you want to apologize to me and tell me why you did it and what real feelings of insecurity and jealousy but don't Dylan do that Tim Dillon put a great post on his page about what's really going on yeah he put a great post on his Instagram and that's when I became friends with Tim right he wrote you're getting a bunch of people that are mediocre comedians yeah and that are attacking him not really because of what he's saying but because he's great and because they hate the fact that he was getting any attention at all and that should be theirs and now they find some chance to move up in the social structure yeah that that's what it felt like to me all of that is totally true and it's makes me understand it in other words it makes me feel sympathy it makes me go like all right if that's what you need to do that's what you that's what you got to do it's it's uh I would prefer to hang out with somebody who doesn't need to do that but I get it and I can't be around them because no I understand you can do that again you can do that again you know it's like having a snake in the room like you can have a snake in the room as long as I mean aside from my [ __ ] the thing that was a drag to me about comedy in the last few years was people who any comedian who's out in the world saying that comedian shouldn't be saying these things yeah that's a traitor to Comedy well they always started that's not they're not a real comedian none of them are good they've learned some tricks so they can seem good and they might have a big audience but they're not they don't love this right and they are that's a [ __ ] up thing to do it's a [ __ ] up thing to do and it's always coming from a place of jealousy yes and also it's never it's always happening to somebody who's already deeply besieged somebody who's already the whole world of course when you see the whole world coming down on somebody for something they said and then you go man me I'm going to say the same thing exactly that's about you that has nothing to do with how you really feel about what they said it has nothing to do it's just that you want to be heard in your circle saying it also because you see that you can get a little something from it
